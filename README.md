  <h1>Turtle Crossing Project</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the Turtle Crossing Project! This project is a simple game developed using Python's Turtle graphics library, where you control a turtle trying to cross a road without getting hit by cars.</p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>To play the game, you can follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.</li>
    <li>Run the `turtle_crossing.py` script using a Python interpreter.</li>
    <li>Use the arrow keys to control the turtle and help it cross the road.</li>
    <li>Avoid getting hit by cars and reach the other side to win the game.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>The game consists of a road with cars moving from left to right at different speeds. The turtle starts at the bottom of the screen and can move up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys. The objective of the game is to help the turtle cross the road safely without getting hit by the cars. If the turtle gets hit by a car, the game is over and the player can choose to restart the game.</p>

  <p>The following keyboard controls are used to play the game:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Up Arrow: Move turtle up</li>
    <li>Down Arrow: Move turtle down</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Scoring</h2>
  <p>The game does not have a scoring system. The objective is simply to help the turtle safely cross the road without getting hit by cars.</p>
  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <p>The Turtle Crossing Project uses Python's Turtle graphics library, which is a standard library in Python. No additional external dependencies are required.</p>
